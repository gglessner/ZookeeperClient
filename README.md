python ZookeeperClient.py --audit
```

### Individual Security Tests

Test specific security aspects:

```bash
# Test authentication bypass vulnerabilities
python ZookeeperClient.py --auth-bypass

# Enumerate ACLs on nodes
python ZookeeperClient.py --enumerate-acls

# Scan for sensitive data exposure
python ZookeeperClient.py --data-exposure

# Test privilege escalation opportunities
python ZookeeperClient.py --privilege-escalation

# Test information disclosure
python ZookeeperClient.py --info-disclosure
```

### Data Discovery & Analysis

Advanced data discovery and analysis features:

```bash
# Search for specific patterns in node names and data
python ZookeeperClient.py --search-pattern "database|password|secret"

# Export all discovered data to JSON file
python ZookeeperClient.py --export-data zk_data.json

# Extract credentials, tokens, and keys from discovered data
python ZookeeperClient.py --harvest-creds

# Analyze configuration patterns and extract service endpoints
python ZookeeperClient.py --analyze-configs

# Perform deep recursive scanning with comprehensive coverage
python ZookeeperClient.py --deep-scan
```

### Custom Server Configuration

```bash
# Audit specific ZooKeeper server
python ZookeeperClient.py --server zk1.example.com:2181 --audit

# Test with custom timeout
python ZookeeperClient.py --server zk1.example.com:2181 --timeout 30 --audit
```

### TLS/SSL Secure Connections

Connect to ZooKeeper servers with TLS/SSL encryption:

```bash
# Basic TLS connection (default port 2281)
python ZookeeperClient.py --tls --server zk1.example.com:2281

# TLS with client certificate authentication
python ZookeeperClient.py --tls --cert-file client.pem --key-file client.key --server zk1.example.com:2281

# TLS with CA certificate verification
python ZookeeperClient.py --tls --ca-file ca.pem --server zk1.example.com:2281

# TLS without certificate verification (not recommended for production)
python ZookeeperClient.py --tls --no-verify-ssl --server zk1.example.com:2281

# Comprehensive audit with TLS
python ZookeeperClient.py --tls --cert-file client.pem --key-file client.key --ca-file ca.pem --server zk1.example.com:2281 --audit
```

### Quick Connection Test

Simple connectivity test without security scanning:
```bash
python test_connection.py
```

## Security Tests Explained

### Authentication Bypass Testing
Tests common default credentials and authentication schemes:
- `admin:admin`, `zookeeper:zookeeper`, `admin:password`
- Empty credentials and various authentication schemes
- Identifies weak or default authentication configurations

### ACL Enumeration
Recursively discovers Access Control Lists on ZooKeeper nodes:
- Maps out permission structures
- Identifies overly permissive ACLs
- Finds nodes with no access controls

### Data Exposure Scanning
Scans for sensitive data patterns in node values:
- Passwords, secrets, keys, tokens
- Configuration data, database connections
- Internal endpoints and credentials

### Privilege Escalation Testing
Tests ability to create/modify nodes in sensitive locations:
- `/admin`, `/config`, `/system`, `/internal`
- `/security`, `/users`, `/auth`, `/credentials`
- Tests ACL modification capabilities
- **Automatically cleans up all test nodes**

### Information Disclosure Testing
Tests access to system and internal paths:
- `/zookeeper`, `/zookeeper/config`
- `/system`, `/admin`, `/internal`
- `/debug`, `/metrics`

## Security Considerations

### Legal and Ethical Use
- Only use this tool on systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Comply with applicable laws and regulations

### Production Environment Safety
- **All tests are designed to be production-safe**
- **Automatic cleanup ensures no artifacts remain**
- **No DoS or destructive testing included**
- Monitor system resources during testing

### Common Findings
- **Weak Authentication**: Default credentials or no authentication
- **Overly Permissive ACLs**: World-readable or world-writable nodes
- **Data Exposure**: Sensitive configuration data stored in plain text
- **Information Disclosure**: Access to system paths and metrics
- **Privilege Escalation**: Ability to create nodes in sensitive locations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
- Verify ZooKeeper server is running and accessible
- Check firewall settings and network connectivity
- Ensure correct server:port format

### Permission Errors
- Some tests may fail due to legitimate access controls
- This is expected behavior and indicates proper security

### Timeout Issues
- Increase timeout value for slow networks: `--timeout 30`
- Check network latency and server performance

### Cleanup Issues
- If cleanup fails, manually remove any test nodes with patterns:
  - `/test_privilege_escalation_*`
  - `/test_node_*`
  - `/auth_test_*`
